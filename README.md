## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If Python is not already installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads).

## Installation

There's no need to install anything other than Python. Tkinter is included with Python by default.

## Usage

Upon running the program, you'll see a GUI window with the following components:

- An input field where you can enter a year.
- A "Generate Calendar" button.
- A text area where the calendar for the specified year will be displayed.

To generate a calendar, follow these steps:

1. Enter a year in the input field.
2. You can also automatically generate the calendar by typing the year, as the calendar updates on each key release in the input field.
3. The program will display the calendar for the specified year in the text area.
4. If the input is not a valid year (i.e., not a positive integer between 1 and 9999), the program will display an error message.
